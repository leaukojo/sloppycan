  "notes": [
    "Carlito signal contract. Defines every signal crossing the sloppyCAN<->game bridge.",
    "Signals are unique by (name, dir). 'battery' exists in both directions on purpose: in = warning LED, out = battery voltage.",
    "'type'/'unit'/'range' are packing hints; CAN frame IDs and byte layout live on the sloppyCAN side and are finalized there together with carlito.js.",
    "'warn' (optional number, added v3) is the danger threshold the dashboard highlights: the tachometer redline, low-fuel, coolant overheat. The dash infers low- vs high-side from which end of 'range' it sits near.",
    "'flavor' borrows a protocol's signal names/semantics (j1939, isobus, cleanopen, canaerospace, dronecan) without implementing its CAN frames — frame layout stays on the sloppyCAN side.",
    "'cleanopen' is the only flavor on a SECOND NETWORK rather than the vehicle's own bus: CiA 422 (EN 16815:2019) is a CANopen body-control network, so the garbage truck's body signals reach the J1939 chassis across a CiA 413-6 truck-gateway interface and appear on the truck's cluster per CiA 413-8. The gateway is the content — body_inhibit is computed from chassis state and published on the body network, and body_bus can be down.",
    "'iso11992' is the TRAILER bus (ISO 11992-2 over pins 6 and 7 of the ISO 7638 connector), and how LITTLE rides it is the content: part 2 is the application layer for brakes and running gear only, so a coupling claim, the brake demand going out (EBS11), the ABS state coming back (EBS21), an axle load and an injectable fault are the ENTIRE boundary. It is the one signal group here that is bidirectional by design, and it deliberately carries no body type at all — see trailer_connected. Contrast 'cleanopen' above: the body network is thick (a second bus with its own profile behind a gateway), the trailer network is thin (four messages about brakes), and both are real.",
    "'j2497' is the REGIONAL CONTRAST to 'iso11992', and the contrast is a SUBTRACTION rather than a second set of messages: SAE J2497 (PLC4TRUCKS) is what North America put on the truck/trailer boundary, and it is not a bus at all — the ISO 7638 connector has no data pair over there, so trailer ABS status is modulated onto the POWER LINE and its payload is essentially LAMP ON / LAMP OFF to one dash telltale. So this flavor has exactly ONE signal (trailer_abs_lamp) and that single mirrored bit is the whole protocol. A tractor unit without the ISO 11992 data pair (VehicleSpec.trailer_bus_equipped false — the shipped 'semi-conventional') tows and brakes exactly the same trailer through the same pneumatic lines and publishes nothing about it: thin, thinner, and both are real.",
    "'j1939' and 'isobus' are parent and child: ISO 11783 (ISOBUS) is built on SAE J1939, so a handful of signals carry the isobus flavor and are shared with the truck — engine_load is J1939 SPN 92 whichever family reads it, and the tractor's was always the borrowed one. Signals the truck alone declares are flavored j1939.",
    "'train' is the one flavor that borrows PRACTICE, not a protocol: real trains run IEC 61375 (TCN/WTB/MVB, not CAN) and the CAN-adjacent CiA 421 profiles use an object dictionary that does not fit this flat (name, dir) model. The train signals are custom flat signals whose semantics are borrowed from rail practice / CiA 421.",
    "No entries are \"status\": \"todo\"; a planned-but-unimplemented signal would use that marker.",
    "Contract edits bump 'version'; both sides warn on mismatch instead of failing silently."

The two report it UNEQUALLY, and that is worth knowing before reading the cluster rather than being discovered as a bug: axle_load is summed suspension force, so it moves the moment the payload lands, while engine_load only reaches the payload through the rpm the drivetrain sags to — it answers under throttle and on a grade, and a loaded truck holding a steady speed on the flat reads the same load as an empty one.
